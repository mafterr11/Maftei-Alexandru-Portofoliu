The cookie is installed by a request issued by a web server to a browser (e.g., Internet Explorer, Chrome, Mozilla) and is completely 'passive' (it does not contain software programs, viruses, or spyware and cannot access the user's hard drive information). Cookies are used for authentication as well as to collect information such as the browser type and operating system, the source page, the domain name from which the visitor connected to the site, with the purpose of making it possible to recognize the user's device, understand how visitors use the web page, and present the site's content in a relevant manner, adapted to the user's preferences.",

They are also used in preparing aggregated anonymous statistics that help understand how a user benefits from www.myriad-tech.ro, allowing for the improvement of the site's structure and content, but excluding the personal identification of the user. We use session and persistent cookies (temporary files that remain in the user's device until the session ends, the application/browser is closed, or until they are manually deleted by the user). The cookies used by the partners of a web page operator, including, without limitation, the users of the web page, are subject to the respective privacy policy.",
    "3": "The personal data collected through the use of cookies may be collected only to facilitate certain functionalities for the user and are encrypted in a way that makes it impossible for unauthorized persons to access them. Generally, an application used to access web pages allows the saving of cookies on the device by default. These settings can be changed so that the automatic administration of cookies is blocked by the web browser, or the user is informed each time cookies are sent to their device. Detailed information about the possibilities and ways of managing cookies can be found in the settings area of the application (web browser). Limiting the use of cookies can affect certain functionalities of www.myriad-tech.ro.",
    "4": "Cookies are central to the efficient functioning of the Internet, helping to generate a friendly browsing experience adapted to the preferences and interests of each user. Refusing or disabling cookies can make some sites impossible to use. Due to their flexibility and the fact that most of the largest and most visited sites use cookies, they are almost unavoidable; disabling them will not allow the user to access the most widespread and used sites, such as YouTube, Gmail, Yahoo, Facebook, Pinterest, and others.",
    "5": "Examples of important uses of cookies: Marketing cookies are mainly used by advertising agencies to store a user's visits and searches on the web and to display relevant and engaging ads based on recent searches. Preference-related cookies, connected to the categories of products and services offered, allow the site to remember information such as the preferred language or the area where the user is located.

Consequently, they cannot duplicate or replicate on other networks to run or replicate again. Since they cannot perform these functions, they cannot be considered viruses. However, cookies can be used for negative purposes because they store information about the users' preferences and browsing history on a specific site or across multiple sites, being used as a form of spyware (spying on consumer activity). Many anti-spyware products constantly mark cookies for deletion during anti-virus/anti-spyware scanning procedures. Generally, browsers have integrated privacy settings that provide different levels of cookie acceptance, validity period, and automatic deletion after the user has visited a specific site. Since identity protection is highly valuable and is the right of every internet user, it is advisable to know what potential issues cookies might create. Because they constantly transmit information between the browser and the website in both directions, if an attacker or unauthorized person intervenes in the data transmission path, the information contained in the cookie can be intercepted.

    "9": "Many spyware detection and prevention applications include detecting attacks on websites. Thus, they prevent the browser from accessing websites that could exploit the browser's vulnerabilities or download dangerous software. It is recommended to constantly update browsing programs because many cookie-based attacks are carried out by exploiting the weaknesses of old browser versions. All modern browsers offer the possibility to change cookie settings. These settings are usually found in the 'options' or 'preferences' menu of the browser. The cookie policy may be updated periodically. Therefore, the user needs to check this section to stay informed of any changes.
